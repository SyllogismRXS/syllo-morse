A template for a new robot called <turtlebot> has been 
added to the <turtlebot_sim> environment.

----------------------------------------------------------
To complete the equipment of your robot, edit:
/home/syllogismrxs/repos/syllo-morse/turtlebot_sim/src/turtlebot_sim/builder/robots/turtlebot.py

You can also modify its Blender mesh:
/home/syllogismrxs/repos/syllo-morse/turtlebot_sim/data/turtlebot_sim/robots/turtlebot.blend

For advanced usage, you may also edit its internal 
definition here:
/home/syllogismrxs/repos/syllo-morse/turtlebot_sim/src/turtlebot_sim/robots/turtlebot.py
----------------------------------------------------------

To use the robot in your simulation script, add the following
lines:


from turtlebot_sim.builder.robots import Turtlebot

# add a new turtlebot robot in the simulation
turtlebot = Turtlebot()
#turtlebot.translate(...)
#turtlebot.add_default_interface('socket')


----------------------------------------------------------
Happy simulation!
